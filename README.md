# elms This is a employee leave management system for my uni assignment in a console based. The ide that I am using is visual 
studio 2017. Most of the text file is use to save the employee data. There 3 main user for this system who are lecturer,
academic leader and HR admininstrator. Lecturer only can apply leave and view leave status. Leave status will be approve by 
academic leader while HR admin can create new/delete employee profile, update no.of public holiday, and QnA.
